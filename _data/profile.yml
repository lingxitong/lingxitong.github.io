I am Xitong Ling, a Masterâ€™s student at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, where I conduct research in Pathology AI under the supervision of Prof. Yonghong He and Prof. Tian Guan. My academic journey began with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from Beihang University, and I am now deeply engaged in the field of medical artificial intelligence.
My research interests lie in several cutting-edge areas, including 1) Multiple Instance Learning, 2) Multimodal Learning, 3) Self-supervised Learning, 4) Foundation Models, and 5) Causal Inference. These topics are at the forefront of AI research and hold great potential for transforming healthcare and medical diagnostics.
I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities to further explore these areas and contribute to the development of advanced AI technologies. I am particularly interested in collaborating with researchers from diverse fields to drive innovation and address complex challenges. If you share similar interests or have opportunities to discuss, I would be thrilled to connect with you.

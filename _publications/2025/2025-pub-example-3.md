  PathOrchestra, a pathology foundation model, addresses challenges in computational pathology by using self-supervised learning on a large dataset of 300K slides from 20 tissue types. It was evaluated on 112 clinical tasks, demonstrating strong performance in tasks like pan-cancer classification and biomarker assessment. PathOrchestra also explores multimodal tasks, including generating structured reports for colorectal cancer and lymphoma, showcasing its potential for clinical application.

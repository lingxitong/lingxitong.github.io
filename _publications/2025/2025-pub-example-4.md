abstract: >-
  GI diseases pose a significant clinical burden, necessitating precise diagnostics. Conventional histopathology, relying on subjective pathologist interpretation, suffers from limited reproducibility. To address this and the lack of specialized pathology models for GI diseases, we developed Digepath, a GI pathology foundation model. It employs a dual-phase optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening to detect sparse lesion areas in WSIs. Pretrained on over 353 million patches from 200,000 slides, Digepath achieves state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 GI pathology tasks, including diagnosis, molecular prediction, and prognosis evaluation. It also demonstrates near-perfect sensitivity for early GI cancer screening across multiple institutions, highlighting its potential to enhance histopathological practice and serve as a paradigm for other pathology subspecialties.

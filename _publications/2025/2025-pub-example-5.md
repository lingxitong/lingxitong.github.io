abstract: >-
  Computational pathology is emerging as a transformative diagnostic approach, leveraging AI to enable data-driven analysis of histopathological images. However, the ultra-high resolution of whole slide images (WSIs) challenges traditional image analysis methods. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) addresses this by treating WSIs as weakly supervised "bags of instances," yet current MIL methods lack standardization, hindering reproducibility. To resolve this, we present MIL-BASELINE, a modular and extensible library for unified, reproducible MIL in computational pathology, supporting rapid prototyping and benchmarking.

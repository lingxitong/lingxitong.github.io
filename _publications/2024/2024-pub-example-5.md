abstract: >-
  Foundation models have transformed digital pathology by enabling quantitative analysis of histological patterns and cancer-specific signals. Yet, their static features limit adaptability to diverse clinical needs. We propose PathFiT, a plug-and-play dynamic feature learner that enhances the flexibility of pathology foundation models across varied tasks. To evaluate PathFiT, we build a 20TB benchmark covering 28 H&E-stained and 7 specialized imaging tasks. PathFiT achieves state-of-the-art results on 34 of 35 tasks, with notable gains on 23 and a 10.20% improvement on specialized imaging. These results highlight its strong adaptability and performance across digital pathology.

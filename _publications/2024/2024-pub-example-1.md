abstract: >-
  Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification in histopathology faces challenges due to gigapixel resolution and lack of fine-grained annotations. Existing MIL-based attention mechanisms often neglect inter-instance relations and suffer from high complexity. We propose AMD-MIL, an agent-based aggregator with a mask denoise mechanism, which dynamically filters noise and enhances critical feature representations. Experiments on CAMELYON and TCGA datasets demonstrate superior performance and interpretability.

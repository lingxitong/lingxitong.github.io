  Quantization enables deep learning on IoT devices by compressing neural networks, but most methods require private training data. Zero-shot quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by quantizing without access to training data. However, low-bit-width ZSQ faces challenges like hard logits matching, unstable feature alignment, and low synthetic data diversity. This article introduces S-ZSQ, a novel ZSQ framework that enhances knowledge transfer and synthetic data generation, enabling low-bit-width quantized networks to learn more effectively from full-precision networks. It achieves significant improvements on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-1k with fewer fine-tuning epochs. For example, it outperforms AdaDFQ by 8.08%/11.16% in top-1 accuracy on 3-bit ResNet-18/ResNet-50 cases.

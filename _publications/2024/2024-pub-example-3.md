  Optical microscopy advancements have enabled whole slide imaging (WSI), facilitating AI-powered computational pathology (CPath). The Camelyon datasets are widely used benchmarks, yet label quality and clinical relevance remain underexplored. In this study, we reprocessed 1,399 WSIs from Camelyon-16 and -17, removing low-quality slides, correcting labels, and adding expert annotations to the test set. We refined the binary cancer task into a four-class classification: negative, ITC, micro-, and macro-metastasis. Using this cleaned dataset, we re-evaluated foundational models and MIL methods, offering a stronger benchmark for AI in histopathology.
